===================
Authentication Server
===================

Authentication-Server validates GCS and units by checking against predefined accounts, and subsequently directs the units to the assigned communication server. 
The accounts can be stored in various formats such as MySQL database, JSON file or as a single account defined in the server.config file.
Nodejs was used to develop the module, resulting in high portability and ease of comprehension and modification.
