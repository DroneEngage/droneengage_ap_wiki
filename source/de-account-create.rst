====================================
Create your Drone-Engage Account Key
====================================

To get access to Drone-Engage you need to register and get :term:`Access Code` from `Account Manager <http://cloud.ardupilot.org:8001/accounts.html>`_.
This is a very straight forward step. You will recieve an :term:`Access Code` on your email that you need to save and use in all your drones.


To validate your new account please login to `Drone-Engage Web Client <https://cloud.ardupilot.org:8001/webclient.html>`_.

This access code will also be used on your Raspberry PI to configure the Communication Client (de_comm.so) 
that connects your vehicle to the Drone Engage server and web client.
.. tip::
    You only need one account for all your drones.
