Connecting your mobile device to the serial port of an FCB requires two main adapters: an OTG (On-The-Go) converter and a USB to TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) converter. First, connect the OTG converter to your mobile device. Next, plug the USB to TTL converter into the OTG converter. This setup will provide the necessary TX (transmit) and RX (receive) lines for you to establish a serial connection with your FCB.
