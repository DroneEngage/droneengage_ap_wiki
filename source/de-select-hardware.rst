Select Your Hardware
====================

All you need to have is a Raspberry-Pi board with some kind of connection to the internet. You can use RPI 2,3,4 & Zero/Zero2. This board model determines the capabilities of your system. 
Using RPI-4 enables you to run video streaming module from multiple cameras. This module allows you to connect multiple cameras and stream from them simultaneously.

If you need a telemetry then RPI-Zero is a perfect fit.

A connection to the internet is also required. 
The simplest option for this is a USB 4G or LTE data stick, but you could also use a "HAT" that 
has a 4G, LTE or even 5G modem on board.  

`Raspberry-PI Zero 2 W  <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/>`_ has been available since last quarter of 2021. It has a quad-core, 
and is 5 times more powerful than Raspberry Zero W. This is your best choice if you want to use a single camera for FPV. You can select it by select it
to save power and weight. RPI-4 will be your option if you want multiple cameras and for future more sophesticated modules.

.. tip::

      It is recommended to have RPI-Zero for telemetry only and RPI-4 for telemetry + streaming video.
