   Web UDP Telemetry </webclient-udp-telemetry>



Drone-Engage integrates with `Ardupilot-based flight control boards <https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html>`_. Drone-Engage can connect to these boards via Serial, Bluetooth, Wifi, USB, TCP and UDP connections. 

The below video might be a record-breaking telemetry range for RC. In the following video you can see a car is being control in Cairo Egypt.driver is in Los-Angeles USA. **Andruav 12,193 km RC Car Demo**.

The first Video captured in USA

.. youtube:: DmpX-D10GyQ


While the second is captured in Egypt

.. youtube:: Kh4NU3FaFeE


Both are the same exact video filmed from two places.

.. tip::

   **Andruav 12,193 km RC Car Demo** :ref:`here <de-telemetry>` is done by connecting joystick to Mission Planner via Andruav Telemetry. However it is recommended to use `GamePad Directly <https://andruav.com/webclient-gamepad.html>`_.


Although the video was made using Andruav at that time. Drone-Engage is even more capable and more optimized for this types of missions.
