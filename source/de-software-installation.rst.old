Software Installation
=====================

System installation is a straightforward process, beginning with a functional Raspberry Pi board with SSH access.  Raspberry Pi OS can be obtained from the `official website <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/>`_. Software packages for Drone-Engage are available for download `here <https://cloud.ardupilot.org/downloads/>`_.

The "Video" package is required for camera integration. For 64-bit Bullseye, download `this version <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2023-02-22/2023-02-21-raspios-bullseye-arm64-lite.img.xz>`_.  Please check :ref:`de-dev-building-code` if you want to build your own binaries.
On the otherside ready made images are available here :ref:`de-install`.

Steps
=====

Ensure the Raspberry Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Legacy) (https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_oldstable_lite_armhf/images/raspios_oldstable_lite_armhf-2022-01-28/2022-01-28-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip) or that legacy camera support is enabled on Bullseye-64.  Camera support is essential if using a camera module. For Bullseye-64, enable legacy camera support using `raspi-config`.

.. important::
   For Bullseye, enable "Legacy Camera Support" via `raspi-config`.

Visit the `Drone-Engage website <https://www.droneengage.com>`_ and select "Download Application" `link <https://cloud.ardupilot.org/downloads>`_.

Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh pi@raspberry_pi_ip_address

   mkdir tmp
   cd tmp
   wget <FilePath>
   unzip <File.zip>
   chmod +x ./install_droneengage.sh

Initiate the installation:

.. code-block:: bash

   chmod +x ./install_droneengage.sh
   ./install_droneengage.sh

This script extracts the `drone_engage` directory, containing the `de_comm` (communication with the Drone-Engage server) and `de_mavlink` (communication with the flight controller) applications.  It also configures these applications to run automatically on boot.

Configuring Apps
================

The installation script allows editing of essential fields. Manual configuration is also possible via text editor.

Update account details (email and :term:`Access Code`) and optionally set a vehicle name in `./drone_engage/de_comm/config.module.json`:

.. code-block:: bash

   nano ./drone_engage/de_comm/config.module.json

Configure the flight controller connection in `./drone_engage/de_mavlink/config.module.json`. Options include UDP (for Linux FCBs like [OBAL](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-obal-overview.html)) and serial (using TX/RX pins).

Further details on this file can be found in :ref:`de-config-comm`.

.. code-block:: bash

   nano ./drone_engage/de_mavlink/config.module.json

Further details on this file can be found in :ref:`de-config-mavlink`.

Ready-Image
===========

A pre-built image for the Raspberry Pi Zero W2, inclusive of all modules including camera support, is available.  See :ref:`de-software-installation_download` for details.
